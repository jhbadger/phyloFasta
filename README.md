PhyloFasta
==========

Phylogenetic programs have the annoying feature of typically requiring
awkward formats for data input, while most people using modern
alignment programs like MUSCLE typically keep their alignments in
straight-forward aligned FASTA files. So I've written wrappers around
various phylogenetic programs to take in aligned FASTA alignments and
convert them to whatever the program needs. Plus I have tried to keep
arguments consistent across programs to make running various programs
on the same alignment convenient. I use the Trollop option parser so
that the programs are self-documenting by simply running them without
any arguments.

Requirements
============

While each wrapper obviously requires the phylogenetic program in
question, there are several Ruby gems that are required:

The programs will report if any gems or programs are missing.
